# 🛒 Grocery Sales Data Processing & Analytics

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Grocery Sales Data Processing & Analytics** project is a data transformation pipeline built using **dbt (Data Build Tool)** to transform raw grocery sales data into structured, analytics-ready datasets.

The project processes grocery sales, store, transaction, oil price, and holiday/event data through a layered data architecture:

**Bronze → Silver → Gold**

The pipeline uses **dbt models, SQL transformations, source definitions, reusable macros, and dimensional data modeling** to create clean and analytics-ready datasets for downstream reporting and analysis.

The project is based on the grocery sales dataset containing historical sales information across stores, product families, transactions, promotions, oil prices, and holidays.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

* Build a structured grocery sales data transformation pipeline using dbt.
* Organize raw data using a **Bronze → Silver → Gold** architecture.
* Create reusable staging models for raw source datasets.
* Clean and standardize grocery sales and store information.
* Combine sales data with store, oil price, and holiday information.
* Build intermediate models for data enrichment and transformation.
* Create analytical fact and dimension tables.
* Implement a dimensional **star schema** for analytics.
* Improve data transformation modularity and maintainability using dbt.
* Maintain a clear separation between raw, transformed, and analytics-ready data.

# 🏗️ ELT Design

## 🥉 Bronze Layer – Raw Data

The **Bronze layer** represents the raw source datasets before business transformations.

The project defines the Bronze source as:

`adb_p2_grocery_serverless.bronze`

with the following source tables:

* `train`
* `test`
* `stores`
* `transactions`
* `oil`
* `holidays_events`

These sources are registered in `models/sources.yml`.

### Bronze Data Flow

```text

       │
       ▼

       │
       ├── train
       ├── test
       ├── stores
       ├── transactions
       ├── oil
       └── holidays_events
```

---

## 🥈 Silver Layer – Staging & Intermediate Transformations

The Silver layer contains the cleaned, standardized, and enriched datasets.

The project separates Silver transformations into two stages:

### Staging Models

The `models/staging/` directory contains:

* `stg_train.sql`
* `stg_test.sql`
* `stg_stores.sql`
* `stg_transactions.sql`
* `stg_oil.sql`
* `stg_holidays_events.sql`

These models provide the first transformation layer over the Bronze sources.

### Intermediate Models

The `models/intermediate/` directory contains:

* `int_train_sales.sql`
* `int_sales.sql`
* `int_sales_complete.sql`
* `int_sales_enriched.sql`
* `int_sales_oil.sql`

These models combine and enrich the staging datasets before they are consumed by the Gold layer.

For example, `int_sales_enriched` combines sales information with store information to add attributes such as:

* City
* State
* Store type
* Cluster

This creates a more complete sales dataset for downstream analytical models.

## 🥇 Gold Layer – Analytics & Data Marts

The Gold layer contains analytics-ready fact and dimension tables.

The project currently contains the following marts:

| Gold Model    | Purpose                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| `dim_date`    | Date dimension           |
| `dim_product` | Product family dimension |
| `dim_store`   | Store dimension          |
| `fact_sales`  | Sales fact table         |

These models are stored in the `models/marts/` directory.

### ⭐ Fact Table

The `fact_sales` model combines the transformed sales data with store, oil, and holiday attributes.

The resulting fact table includes fields such as:

* Sales ID
* Sales date
* Store number
* Product family
* Sales
* Promotion status
* City
* State
* Store type
* Cluster
* Oil price
* Holiday type
* Holiday locale
* Holiday description

This creates the central analytical dataset for grocery sales analysis.

### 📐 Dimension Tables

#### `dim_product`

Contains distinct grocery product families used in the sales data.

#### `dim_store`

Contains store-level attributes.

#### `dim_date`

Provides date-related attributes for analytical queries.

---

# 📊 Data Model

The Gold layer follows a **Star Schema** design:

![Grocery Sales Star Schema](design/Model.jpeg)


### Fact Table

**fact_sales**

Contains measurable sales information and references the relevant dimensions.

### Dimension Tables

* **dim_date**
* **dim_product**
* **dim_store**

This structure makes the data easier to query and supports analytical workloads.

# 🔄 dbt Transformation Flow

The overall transformation flow is:

```text
                 Bronze Sources
                      │
                      ▼
              ┌───────────────┐
              │    Staging    │
              │    Models     │
              └───────┬───────┘
                      │
                      ▼
              ┌───────────────┐
              │ Intermediate  │
              │    Models     │
              └───────┬───────┘
                      │
                      ▼
              ┌───────────────┐
              │     Marts     │
              │               │
              │ fact_sales    │
              │ dim_date      │
              │ dim_product   │
              │ dim_store     │
              └───────────────┘
```

dbt manages dependencies between models using `ref()` and source definitions.

The project configuration maps:

* **Staging → Silver**
* **Intermediate → Silver**
* **Marts → Gold**

and materializes these models as tables.

# 🧪 Data Quality & Testing

The project is structured to support dbt testing through the `tests/` directory and source/model configuration.

The dbt project defines:

```text
model-paths: ["models"]
analysis-paths: ["analyses"]
test-paths: ["tests"]
seed-paths: ["seeds"]
macro-paths: ["macros"]
snapshot-paths: ["snapshots"]
```

This provides a standardized dbt project structure for transformation, testing, analysis, seeds, macros, and snapshots.

Potential data quality checks include:

* Null validation
* Duplicate detection
* Schema validation
* Referential integrity
* Source validation
* Model-level testing
